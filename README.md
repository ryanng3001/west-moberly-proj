# Worklist and Updates 

## Current progress (as of 26/9) 
- Managed to understand decipher Hazel's script (adapted from Emma's paper)
- Found some packages that were installed but not used (I think) so I removed them
- Fixed minor stuff in the code caused by R updates 

## My worklist 
- [ ] Determine if the 'redundant' libraries are actually redundant or not (think it has something to do with the map visualization)
- [ ] What to do w/ a number of libraries that are retiring Oct 2023?
- [ ] occ_issues (under rgbif) is deprecated - any alternatives?
- [ ] Make a table for plant species, # initial, # after cleaning, time, ...
- [ ] (for the future) Code that allows cleaning for multiple species?
